            <p> Mission statement: To inspire and nurture the human spirit — one person, one candle and one neighborhood
                at a time. Our objective is to maintain "Arah's Candles" standing as one of the most recognized and respected
                brands in the world. To achieve this, we are continuing the disciplined expansion of our global store
                base, adding stores in both existing, developed markets such as the U.S., and in newer, higher growth
                markets such as the Philippines, as well as optimizing the mix of company-operated and licensed stores around the
                world. In addition, by leveraging the experience gained through our traditional store model, we continue
                to offer consumers new candles and other products in a variety of forms, across new categories, diverse
                channels and alternative store formats. We also believe our Arah's Candles Global Social Impact strategy,
                commitments related to ethically sourcing high-quality candles, contributing positively to the
                communities we do business in and being an employer of choice are contributors to our objective.
